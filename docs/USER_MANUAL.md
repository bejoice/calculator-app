Troubleshooting Guide
Common Issues & Solutions
Problem: Calculator shows "Error"
Possible Causes & Fixes:

Division by zero

Example: 5 ÷ 0
Fix: Cannot divide by zero, press AC to clear


Invalid scientific function

Example: Square root of negative number
Fix: Check your input, press AC to reset


Mismatched parentheses

Example: (5 + 3 (missing closing parenthesis)
Fix: Press AC, ensure equal ( and ) brackets



Problem: Keyboard not working
Solutions:

Make sure you're not in Converter mode (keyboard disabled there)
Click anywhere on the calculator to focus it
Check if another application is capturing keyboard input
Refresh the page

Problem: Wrong calculation result
Check these:

Order of operations:

Calculator follows standard order (PEMDAS)
Example: 2 + 3 × 4 = 14 (not 20)
Use parentheses: (2 + 3) × 4 = 20


Trigonometric functions:

Functions use radians, not degrees
For degrees: convert first (degrees × π/180)


Chained operations:

Calculator evaluates step by step
Use = between operations or parentheses



Problem: Display shows scientific notation
Example: 1.234567e+12
What this means:

Number is very large or very small
This is normal for values with >12 digits
e+12 means "× 10^12"

Solution:

This is expected behavior for large numbers
Use a smaller number if you need exact display

Problem: Memory indicator won't disappear
Solution:

Memory still has a stored value
Press MC (Memory Clear) button to reset
Memory persists until manually cleared

Problem: History panel overlaps calculator
Solutions:

Click 📜 icon again to hide history
On smaller screens, scroll to see full calculator
Switch to a device with larger screen

Problem: Theme colors look wrong
Possible Issues:

Different theme selected: Click desired color circle at top
Display settings: Check your device brightness/color settings
Browser issue: Try refreshing the page

Problem: Unit conversion seems incorrect
Verification Steps:

Double-check "From" and "To" units are correct
Verify you selected the right category
Check if you accidentally swapped the units
Try the inverse conversion to verify

Q: Does this calculator save my history when I close the browser?
A: No, history is cleared when you refresh or close. Click entries to reuse values before leaving.
Q: Why does sin(90) not equal 1?
A: The calculator uses radians, not degrees. Use π/2 for 90 degrees (result ≈ 1.57 radians).
Q: Can I calculate with fractions?
A: Use division for fractions. Example: 1/3 + 1/4 → 1 ÷ 3 + 1 ÷ 4
Q: What's the difference between ln and log?
A: ln is natural logarithm (base e), log is common logarithm (base 10).
Q: How do I calculate compound percentages?
A: Calculate each step separately or use parentheses. Example: 20% of 80% → 0.2 × 0.8
Q: Can I use this offline?
A: Depends on implementation. If installed as PWA, yes. Otherwise, requires internet connection.
Q: Is there a limit to calculation size?
A: JavaScript number limits: approximately ±10^308. Display switches to scientific notation after 12 digits.
Q: Why can't I type in Converter mode?
A: Keyboard is disabled in Converter mode. Use the input field provided for the value.
Q: How accurate are the conversions?
A: Very accurate, using standard conversion factors. Results shown to 6 decimal places, trailing zeros removed.
